        A commute is a trip you plan on doing with any sort of frequency.  To add a
        destination, select a start and end location, select a mode of transit and a
        sample time you would commute, then click 'Add'.  When you've entered the
        commutes you want, click 'Get Commute Durations' to bulk-search how long
        each commute takes.
